// PROJECT GOALS
// Team Stats
// We want to create and extract information about your favorite sports team. Basketball,
// soccer, tennis, or water polo, you pick it. Itâ€™s your job to create data using the
// JavaScript data structures at your disposal: arrays, objects, etc.
// Once created, you can manipulate these data structures as well as gain insights from
// them. For example, you might want to get the total number of games your team has played,
// or the average score of all of their games.
