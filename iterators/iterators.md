Imagine you had a grocery list and you wanted to know what each item on the list was. 
You’d have to scan through each row and check for the item. This common task is similar 
to what we have to do when we want to iterate over, or loop through, an array. One tool 
at our disposal is the for loop. However, we also have access to built-in array methods 
which make looping easier.
The built-in JavaScript array methods that help us iterate are called iteration methods, 
at times referred to as iterators. Iterators are methods called on arrays to manipulate 
elements and return values.

Iterator Documentation
There are many additional built-in array methods, a complete list of which is on the (MDN’s Array iteration methods page).
